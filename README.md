This is the git to my flappy bird game in python. Use space to jump and r to restart. Be careful not to bump in a pillar. To play go to the itch.io link or just access it from here. https://matek50939.itch.io/flappy-bird If you don't want to play in the browser you can copy tho main.py code (click on it and then copy) or download it and then play on a python complier (pycharm is the best one, others might not work). Also you might need to install some modules such as pygame and asyncio(the module for making it web playable) to install the modules go to the terminal and type "pip install pygame" and then "pip install asyncio". I presonallyu recommend playing on itch.io on the browser. Have fun!
